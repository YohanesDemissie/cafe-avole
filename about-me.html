      <p class="about-content">
        I want Café Avole to embody a feeling of fellowship year round for this neighborhood and the surrounding neighborhoods in
        Southeast Seattle. In order to succeed, I'v asked for financial support and the community responded. I launched an online campaign
        (tinyurl.com/CafeAvole) to raise a grand total of $17,407.50 to purchase the equipment needed to get Café Avole up and
        running.

      <p class="about-content">
        I'v also seeked community members who can support a street outreach team, marketing programs, business
        development, all skills that Café Avole needs for its mission to better our community. From there on, I've utilized my new found resources on rebuilding the community I grew up in.
        I am able to serve my community, as well as provide a venue for programs and organizations to come together in efforts
        to build a family out of Rainier Avenue, and an outlet for the youth in a positive, creative, and product manner.
      </p>

        Thank you all who have made contribution towards making my vision come true, and those that continue to reach out and lend a helping hand to run events and rebuild our community we love and cherish.
